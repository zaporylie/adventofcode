Advent Of Code 2017
===========

Nothing special here, just me:
+ testing Symfony 4
+ writing Console Commands
+ solving Advent of Code challenge
+ having soooo much fun ðŸ˜ƒ

## Want to run it yourself?

```bash 
composer install
# app:day:one or app:day:two or app:day:three:extra etc.
php bin/console app:day:one [input]
php bin/console app:day:one:extra [input]
```

## No spoiler policy

In order not to spoil fun for others I pledge not to publish results before end of a day.
